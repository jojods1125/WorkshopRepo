You found the merge branch!

This branch was created by branching from joseph/readme and
merging joseph/note2 into it.

Please note that you SHOULD NOT do this in practice. If this was
an actual project, I would have either merged /note2 directly
into /readme, or I would have merged /readme and /note2 into
master. I am doing this solely so you can see how merging works.
